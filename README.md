# LeetCode Practice

Solving problems with a focus on **pattern recognition** rather than memorization. Each solution includes my thought process, pattern identification, and complexity analysis.

## Structure
- Organized by patterns (two pointers, sliding window, etc.)
- Each problem has time/space complexity notes
- Focus on understanding why solutions work

## Patterns Tracked
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window  
- Hash Maps
- Stack/Queue
- Binary Search
- BFS/DFS
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking

Learning through repetition and connecting similar problems.
